# Traffic Sign Detection and Classification

## Overview
This project implements a real-time traffic sign detection and classification system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system can detect and classify various traffic signs from video streams or images, making it useful for autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems.

## Features
- Real-time traffic sign detection
- Multi-class traffic sign classification
- Support for video streams and image inputs
- High accuracy and fast processing
- Visualization of detection results
